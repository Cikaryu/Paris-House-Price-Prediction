Machine learning project to predict house prices in Paris using regression methodsmachine learning project to predict house prices in Paris using regression methods
We want a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on factors such as location, size, amenities, etc. over time.

#### The ideal outcome we want from our ML?
The ideal outcome of a house price prediction model is to provide price estimates that are close to or reflect the actual price of the house based on certain features such as the number of rooms, land area, location, and others.
We want our model to provide near-accurate and informative predictions, helping potential users make smart decisions in the sale or purchase of a home. The ultimate goal is to have a model that can provide a near-accurate price prediction or reflect the actual price of a home.

#### How will we know if the ML system has failed?
Our success metric is how easily can users (potential home sellers and buyers) interact with this machine learning system to find out house price predictions so that users can understand and trust the prediction results. And these predictions can help users make decisions about buying and selling houses in the area.

Our ML model is considered unsuccessful if the results are not accurate with the actual house price data and are slow in generating price predictions

#### The desired output results of the Machine Learning (ML) model to be built.
The desired output of this machine learning model is the house price in Euro which can provide a predicted value that is close to the actual price. 

Here is an example of the output that can be generated by this machine learning model: Predicted price of the house : â‚¬ 1003895.76

#### When is the output obtained from our machine learning model, and how is it used?
The output of the machine learning (ML) model will be obtained every time there is new data about the house for sale. The results of the house price prediction are then used to provide an estimate of the value of the house to be sold or bought.

Example:
Whenever there is new information about a house for sale, our ML model outputs a price prediction that is closer to the actual value. These predictions are used to give homeowners a more accurate view of the property's value in the market. This information can help in setting a competitive sales price that is in line with the market value.

#### Solve the problem if not using ML?
If not using ML, we will adopt a heuristic approach by considering common factors such as location, number of rooms, and land area. For example, properties in premium locations with many public facilities and a larger number of rooms may score higher. This heuristic can provide fairly accurate results for houses that are similar to those for which there is existing data. However, it may not be accurate for homes that are unique or have no similar data.
